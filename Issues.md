# GitHub Issues Status & Response Plan

## Ready for Closure (Fixed in develop branch)

### Issue #1: "Can not install by upip" 
- **Creator**: @iBobik (Nov 16, 2018)
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Fix**: Added fallback handling for missing `sdist_upip` dependency in `setup.py`
- **Response**: "Fixed in develop branch. The setup.py now handles missing sdist_upip gracefully with proper fallback. Please test with `upip.install('micropython-wifimanager')` and confirm this resolves your installation issue."

### Issue #4: "upip install fails"
- **Creator**: @deimi (May 7, 2020) 
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED
- **Fix**: Same as #1 - setup.py packaging improvements + version URL fix
- **Response**: "This should be resolved by the same fix as Issue #1. The packaging has been improved to handle upip installation failures. Please test and let us know if you still encounter issues."

### Issue #3: "WiFiManager Generates a Traceback/OSError: [Errno 5] EIO on TinyPico"
- **Creator**: @wwestrup (Feb 25, 2020)
- **Status**: ✅ LIKELY FIXED  
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive OSError handling in network operations (scan, connect, AP config)
- **Response**: "Added comprehensive error handling for hardware compatibility issues in the develop branch. The code now gracefully handles OSError exceptions during network scanning, connection attempts, and AP configuration. Please test on your TinyPico and confirm if this resolves the EIO errors."

## Feature Requests (IMPLEMENTED in develop branch)

### Issue #6: "Feature Request: Execute callback function when wifi connection state changes"
- **Creator**: @jonathanfoster (May 31, 2021)
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Implementation**: Added complete connection state callback system with 4 event types
- **Features**: 
  - `WifiManager.on_connection_change(callback)` registration
  - Events: connected, disconnected, ap_started, connection_failed
  - Rich event data (SSID, IP, failed networks)
  - Multiple callback support with exception handling
- **Response**: "Implemented! The develop branch now includes a comprehensive connection state callback system. You can register callbacks with `WifiManager.on_connection_change(your_function)` to receive events for 'connected', 'disconnected', 'ap_started', and 'connection_failed'. Each event includes relevant data like SSID, IP address, etc. Perfect for LED indicators, logging, or application logic. Please test and let us know how it works for your use case!"

### Issue #7: "Feature Request: Provide a REST API to interact with config file"  
- **Creator**: @jonathanfoster (May 31, 2021)
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Implementation**: Added lightweight web configuration interface with HTTP server
- **Features**:
  - HTTP server on port 8080 with browser-based JSON editor
  - HTTP Basic Authentication (admin/password)
  - Live JSON validation and auto-restart after changes
  - Zero dependencies - pure socket + asyncio implementation
- **Response**: "Implemented! The develop branch includes a web configuration interface that's much easier than WebREPL file transfers. Add `\"config_server\": {\"enabled\": true, \"password\": \"yourpass\"}` to your config, then browse to `http://[device-ip]:8080` with username 'admin'. You can edit the JSON configuration directly in the browser with live validation. The AP fallback mechanism provides a safety net for bad configs. Please test and let us know what you think!"

## Closed Issues

### Issue #2: "Webrepl is accessible everywhere if used for AP"
- **Creator**: @iBobik (Apr 25, 2019)
- **Status**: ✅ CLOSED - WORKING AS INTENDED
- **Resolution**: This is expected MicroPython WebREPL behavior, not a WiFiManager issue
- **Response**: "This is expected MicroPython WebREPL behavior when you enable it. WebREPL binds to all interfaces by design. If security is a concern: 1) Set `enables_webrepl: false` in your AP config, 2) Configure WebREPL password via `webrepl_cfg.py`, or 3) Use `start_policy: \"never\"` to disable AP entirely. The WiFiManager gives you control over when WebREPL starts - the security model is handled by MicroPython itself."
