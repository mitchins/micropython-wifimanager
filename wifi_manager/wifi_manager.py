"""Implementation of a controller to connect to preferred wifi network(s) [For ESP8266, micro-python]

Config is loaded from a file kept by default in '/networks.json'

Priority of networks is determined implicitly by order in array, first being the highest.
It will go through the list of preferred networks, connecting to the ones it detects present.

Default behaviour is to always start the webrepl after setup,
and only start the access point if we can't connect to a known access point ourselves.

Future scope is to use BSSID instead of SSID when micropython allows it,
this would allow multiple access points with the same name, and we can select by signal strength.
